abstract: >-
  The HCLS AI Factory transforms patient DNA into ranked novel drug candidates
  in under 5 hours on a single NVIDIA DGX Spark ($3,999). Three GPU-accelerated
  stages — genomics (Parabricks), RAG-grounded target identification (Milvus +
  Claude), and AI-driven drug discovery (BioNeMo MolMIM + DiffDock) — run
  end-to-end on a desktop workstation. The platform includes three domain-specific
  intelligence agents (CAR-T, Imaging, Precision Oncology) and is released under
  Apache 2.0.
